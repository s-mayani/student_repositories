\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to thank Andreas Adelmann and Sonali Mayani for guiding me through
the entire duration of this thesis.
Your valuable inputs as well as the numerous discussions we shared really helped me keeping my work
on the right path, while also giving me the perseverance to press on in times I felt stuck.

Next, I would like to thank Sriramkrishnan Muralikrishnan, Matthias Frey and Antoine Cerfon for
their regular inputs and sharing with me their vast experience with PIC codes in plasma physics. I
greatly appreciated you taking the time for all these discussions and feedback.

Not to forget, I would like to thank all the AMAS group members I was able to spend many lunches and coffee
breaks with. It was always a much welcomed change from working on the thesis.

Lastly, I am greatly indebted to my family for giving me sustained support during the course of my studies.
