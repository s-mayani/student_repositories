We present a numerical solver for the Vlasov-Poisson equation to simulate plasma dynamics including
Coulomb collisions.
The method makes use of a Langevin type operator to approximate inter-particle collisions via
Rosenbluth potentials.
We employ a Particle-in-Cell approach to efficiently simulate the motion of electrons in a
self-consistent manner.
The governing stochastic differential equation introduces a velocity dependent dynamic friction and
diffusion term accounting for the numerous small angle collisions due to Coulomb repulsion in form of a
stochastic process.

We carry out a thorough study on suitable differential operators for computing the Rosenbluth
potentials as well as the collisional coefficients.
The implementation is subsequently tested on a disorder induced heating process in which particle
collisions play an essential role for the system to attain an equilibrium state.
Additionally, we demonstrate the correctness of the computed collisional terms using analytical test
cases.
