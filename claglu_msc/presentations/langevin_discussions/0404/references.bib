In the simplest case of a Lipschitz payoff and a Euler discretisation, the computational cost to achieve an accuracy of O(ϵ) is reduced from O(ϵ−3) to O(ϵ−2 (log ϵ)2). The analysis is supported by numerical results showing significant computational savings.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study of the impact of the nuclear data (cross sections, neutron emission and spectra) on different quantities for spent nuclear fuels (SNF) from Swiss power plants: activities, decay heat, neutron and gamma sources and isotopic vectors. Realistic irradiation histories are considered using validated core follow-up models based on CASMO and SIMULATE. Two Pressurized and one Boiling Water Reactors (PWR and BWR) are considered over a large number of operated cycles. All the assemblies at the end of the cycles are studied, being reloaded or ﬁnally discharged, allowing spanning over a large range of exposure (from 4 to 60 MWd/kgU for ≃9200 assembly-cycles). Both UO2 and MOX fuels were used during the reactor cycles, with enrichments from 1.9 to 4.7\% for the UO2 and 2.2 to 5.8\% Pu for the MOX. The SNF characteristics presented in this paper are calculated with the SNF code. The calculated uncertainties, based on the ENDF/B-VII.1 library are obtained using a simple Monte Carlo sampling method. It is demonstrated that the impact of nuclear data is relatively important (e.g. up to 17\% for the decay heat), showing the necessity to consider them for safety analysis of the SNF handling and disposal.},
