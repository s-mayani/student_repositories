The second challenge is to discover who gave phase space its fully modern name.

We also implement convolution perfectly matched layers on the graphics cards to efficiently absorb outgoing waves on the fictitious edges of the grid. We show that the code that runs on a graphics card gives the expected results by comparing our results to those obtained by running the same simulation on a classical processor core. The methodology that we present can be used for Maxwell's equations as well because their form is similar to that of the seismic wave equation written in velocity vector and stress tensor.}",

The development of cuPentBatch has been motivated by applications involving numerical solutions of parabolic partial differential equations, which we describe. Our solver is written with batch processing in mind (as necessitated by parameter studies of various physical models). In particular, our solver is directed at those problems where only the right-hand side of the matrix changes as the batch solutions are generated. As such, we demonstrate that cuPentBatch outperforms the NVIDIA standard pentadiagonal batch solver gpsvInterleavedBatch for the class of physically-relevant computational problems encountered herein.
Program summary
Program title: cuPentBatch Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/ccrp2pyyyj.1 Licensing Provisions: Apache License 2.0 Programming Languages: C, C++, CUDA Nature of Problem: cuPentBatch has been developed to solve batches of pentadiagonal systems in parallel. Pentadiagonal systems appear commonly in the numerical solution of 4th order derivatives and in 4th order accurate 2nd order derivatives. The need for batch solving these is apparent when preforming parameter studies or when solving 2D/3D systems with inversion methods such as ADI. Solution Method: cuPentBatch implements an LU factorisation for a banded pentadiagonal matrix on a GPU, solving batches of them in parallel across threads. This leads to greatly improved performance over serial and OpenMP implementations, also improves on current state of the art gpsvInterleavedBatch which is part of the cuSPRASE library in CUDA.}

The particle equations of motion and the Maxwell’s equations are differenced implicitly in time by the midpoint rule and solved concurrently by a Jacobian-free Newton Krylov (JFNK) solver. Several tests show that the finite grid instability is eliminated in energy conserving PIC simulations, and the method correctly describes the two-stream and Weibel instabilities, conserving exactly the total energy. The computational time of the energy conserving PIC method increases linearly with the number of particles, and it is rather insensitive to the number of grid points and time step. The kinetic enslavement technique can be effectively used to reduce the problem matrix size and the number of JFNK solver iterations.}

abstract = {The abstraction of a shared memory space over separate CPU and GPU memory domains has eased the burden of portability for many HPC codebases. However, users pay for the ease of use provided by systems-managed memory space with a moderate-to-high performance overhead. NVIDIA Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) is presently the primary real-world implementation of such abstraction and offers a functionally equivalent testbed for a novel in-depth performance study for both UVM and future Linux Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) compatible systems. The continued advocation for UVM and HMM motivates the improvement of the underlying system. We focus on a UVM-based system and investigate the root causes of the UVM overhead, which is a non-trivial task due to the complex interactions of multiple hardware and software constituents and the requirement of targeted analysis methodology.In this paper, we take a deep dive into the UVM system architecture and the internal behaviors of page fault generation and servicing. We reveal specific GPU hardware limitations using targeted benchmarks to uncover driver functionality as a real-time system when processing the resultant workload. We further provide a quantitative evaluation of fault handling for various applications under different scenarios, including prefetching and oversubscription. We find that the driver workload is dependent on the interactions among application access patterns, GPU hardware constraints, and Host OS components. We determine that the cost of host OS components is significant and present across implementations, warranting close attention. This study serves as a proxy for future shared memory systems such as those that interface with HMM.},

We present the layout of the Peking University FEL facility (PKU-FEL), to be driven by a superconducting accelerator, which is currently under construction. PKU-FEL is a test facility designed to study the physical and technical issues of single pass SASE FEL and high-average power FEL. During the intial stage of the IR SASE FEL, the first goal is to demonstrate a high-brightness electron beam and set up a SASE FEL platform to study some novel aspects in physics. In this paper, the study of theoretical and numerical simulations required to design the PKU SASE FEL has been described. A superconducting RF injector and a main linac composed of two 9-cell superconducting cavities are used to produce a high-quality electron beam at about 40MeV. The SASE FEL is designed to reach saturation at 7 μm with a 5-m long hybrid undulator. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. PACS:41.60. Cr; 29.25. Bx; 29.17. + w}

abstract = {Particle-in-cell merging algorithms aim to resample dynamically the six-dimensional phase space occupied by particles without distorting substantially the physical description of the system. Whereas various approaches have been proposed in previous works, none of them seemed to be able to conserve fully charge, momentum, energy and their associated distributions. We describe here an alternative algorithm based on the coalescence of N massive or massless particles, considered to be close enough in phase space, into two new macro-particles. The local conservation of charge, momentum and energy are ensured by the resolution of a system of scalar equations. Various simulation comparisons have been carried out with and without the merging algorithm, from classical plasma physics problems to extreme scenarios where quantum electrodynamics is taken into account, showing in addition to the conservation of local quantities, the good reproducibility of the particle distributions. In case where the number of particles ought to increase exponentially in the simulation box, the dynamical merging permits a considerable speedup, and significant memory savings that otherwise would make the simulations impossible to perform.}

abstract = {An algorithm for the dynamic control of the number of particles in a particle-in-cell (PIC), plasma simulation is presented. The algorithm selectively splits and coalesces particles to control the number of particles in each grid cell. It is designed for multiple-length scale problems where an adaptive grid can be applied and for PIC simulations on parallel computers where a constant number of particles per cell is useful for computational efficiency. The algorithm preserves the charge assignment at grid points while splitting one particle into two, or while coalescing two particles into one. Errors in momentum or energy conservation are controlled by a simple, a priori test. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated in several simulations in one dimension, including a collisionless slow-shock, where an adaptive grid calculation with dynamic number control gives comparable accuracy to a uniformly zoned calculation without dynamic control with just 50% of the effort.}

These sources are designed specifically to use periodic magnetic undulators and low-emittance electron or positron beams to produce high-brightness near-diffraction-limited synchrotron radiation beams. Some of the novel features of the new sources are discussed, along with the characteristics of the radiation produced, with emphasis on the Advanced Light Source, a third-generation 1.5 GeV storage ring optimized for undulator use. A review of the properties of undulator radiation is presented, followed by a discussion of some of the unique challenges being faced by the builders and users of the new undulator sources. These include difficult mechanical and magnetic tolerance limits, a complex interaction with the storage ring, high x-ray beam power, partial coherence, harmonics, optics contamination, and the unusual spectral and angular properties of undulator radiation.",

This generalizes the work of the author described in [8]. The theory is based on a representation of analytical absorbing boundary conditions proven in [8]. These conditions are defined by compositions of first-order, one-dimensional differential operators. Here the operators are discretized individually, and their composition is used as a discretization of the boundary condition. The analysis of stability and reflection properties reduces to separate studies of the individual factors. A representation of the discrete boundary conditions makes it possible to perform the analysis geometrically, with little explicit calculation.},

This may lead to additional noise, reduced accuracy or even unphysical effects.

ABSTRACT = {We employ another approach to quantize electromagnetic fields in the coordinate space, instead of the mode (or Fourier) space, such that local features of photons can be efficiently, physically, and more intuitively described. To do this, coordinate-ladder operators are defined from mode-ladder operators via the unitary transformation of systems involved in arbitrary inhomogeneous dielectric media. Then, one can expand electromagnetic field operators through the coordinate-ladder operators weighted by non-orthogonal and spatially-localized bases, which are propagators of initial quantum electromagnetic (complex-valued) field operators. Here, we call them QEM-CV-propagators. However, there are no general closed form solutions available for them. This inspires us to develop a quantum finite-difference time-domain (Q-FDTD) scheme to numerically time evolve QEM-CV-propagators. In order to check the validity of the proposed Q-FDTD scheme, we perform computer simulations to observe the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect resulting from the destructive interference of two photons in a 50/50 quantum beam splitter.},
