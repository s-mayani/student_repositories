abstract = {Particle-in-cell merging algorithms aim to resample dynamically the six-dimensional phase space occupied by particles without distorting substantially the physical description of the system. Whereas various approaches have been proposed in previous works, none of them seemed to be able to conserve fully charge, momentum, energy and their associated distributions. We describe here an alternative algorithm based on the coalescence of N massive or massless particles, considered to be close enough in phase space, into two new macro-particles. The local conservation of charge, momentum and energy are ensured by the resolution of a system of scalar equations. Various simulation comparisons have been carried out with and without the merging algorithm, from classical plasma physics problems to extreme scenarios where quantum electrodynamics is taken into account, showing in addition to the conservation of local quantities, the good reproducibility of the particle distributions. In case where the number of particles ought to increase exponentially in the simulation box, the dynamical merging permits a considerable speedup, and significant memory savings that otherwise would make the simulations impossible to perform.}

abstract = {An algorithm for the dynamic control of the number of particles in a particle-in-cell (PIC), plasma simulation is presented. The algorithm selectively splits and coalesces particles to control the number of particles in each grid cell. It is designed for multiple-length scale problems where an adaptive grid can be applied and for PIC simulations on parallel computers where a constant number of particles per cell is useful for computational efficiency. The algorithm preserves the charge assignment at grid points while splitting one particle into two, or while coalescing two particles into one. Errors in momentum or energy conservation are controlled by a simple, a priori test. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated in several simulations in one dimension, including a collisionless slow-shock, where an adaptive grid calculation with dynamic number control gives comparable accuracy to a uniformly zoned calculation without dynamic control with just 50% of the effort.}

Here we discuss how one can organize a dynamic rearrangement of the ensemble to reduce the number of macroparticles, while maintaining acceptable sampling of an arbitrary particle distribution. The approaches of merging and thinning as well as their variants are discussed and the aspects of use are considered.}

abstract = {In particle-in-cell simulations and some other statistical computations, the representation of modelled distributions with tracked macro-particles can become locally excessive. Merging or resampling dense clusters or highly-populated phase space volumes may, however, remove or affect small-scale peculiarities in the modelled distribution or cause local changes of conserved quantities, such as energy and momenta. This may lead to additional noise, reduced accuracy or even unphysical effects. Here we describe a probabilistic algorithm for reducing the number of macro-particles in such clusters or volumes so that all the distribution functions are not affected on average and an arbitrary number of conservation laws, distribution central moments and contributions to the grid quantities (such as charge and current density) are preserved.}

In PIC simulations of the charge conservation, a particle trajectory over one time step is conventionally assumed to be a straight line. In the present new scheme we assume that a particle trajectory is a zigzag line. Compared with the Villasenorâ€“Buneman method and Esirkepov's method, the present scheme has an advantage in computation speed without any substantial distortion of physics.}

ABSTRACT = {We employ another approach to quantize electromagnetic fields in the coordinate space, instead of the mode (or Fourier) space, such that local features of photons can be efficiently, physically, and more intuitively described. To do this, coordinate-ladder operators are defined from mode-ladder operators via the unitary transformation of systems involved in arbitrary inhomogeneous dielectric media. Then, one can expand electromagnetic field operators through the coordinate-ladder operators weighted by non-orthogonal and spatially-localized bases, which are propagators of initial quantum electromagnetic (complex-valued) field operators. Here, we call them QEM-CV-propagators. However, there are no general closed form solutions available for them. This inspires us to develop a quantum finite-difference time-domain (Q-FDTD) scheme to numerically time evolve QEM-CV-propagators. In order to check the validity of the proposed Q-FDTD scheme, we perform computer simulations to observe the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect resulting from the destructive interference of two photons in a 50/50 quantum beam splitter.},
