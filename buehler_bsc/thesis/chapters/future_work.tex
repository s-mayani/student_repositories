\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

This thesis is still only the beginning for FEM in IPPL.
In future work, one could continue with higher-order Lagrangian finite elements,
adding support for more boundary conditions
(i.e non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions or periodic boundary conditions) and
process- and thread-level parallelization.
Then it would be interesting to do some timing studies and GPU benchmarks.
After that, more \texttt{FinitElementSpace} classes could be implemented
(i.e. Nédélec or Raviart-Thomas finite elements), on the road to solving the electromagnetic Maxwell equations.

We provide some guidance and our thoughts on the implementation
of some of these topics in Appendix \ref{chp:implementation_help}.
