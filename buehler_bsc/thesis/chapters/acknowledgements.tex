I would like to thank the AMAS group from PSI and Dr. Andreas Adelmann for their support
and their trust to let me begin the work of implementing FEM in the IPPL framework.
I especially want to thank my scientific advisor Ms. Sonali Mayani who supported me greatly
throughout this thesis, it was great working with her.
