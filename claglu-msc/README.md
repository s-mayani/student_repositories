# Master Thesis Personal Repository

This is the repository containing information regarding my Master's Thesis. It mainly contains all my presentations, post-processing notebooks and the final report.



### Simulation Code

The code for this thesis written in IPPL can be found on the following branch in the IPPL repository: https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/Libraries/ippl/-/tree/129-langevin_collision

There is a slideshow explaining how to run this code (run-scripts, default parameters, etc.) on the current repository in following location: `master/presentations/handover/main.pdf`

This effectively boils down to using these [run-scripts](https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/Libraries/ippl/-/tree/129-langevin_collision/alpine/run_scripts) (which contain default arguments) on the aforementioned IPPL branch.



### Overview of this repository

Some directories may contain its own `README.md` that lists its contents further.

Pull all needed packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a new Python environment.

The data used to generate the plots can be found [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/qwEXemjGKWbiFoV) (see Appendix I in the report for more information).

#### Structure:

* `./data_visualization/`: All Jupyter Notebooks and scripts for exploring data generated by `Langevin.cpp` / `TestLangevinPotentials` and the Ulmer's reference P3M implementation (`branch: ippl-orig`)
* `./generalizedHessian/`: Code containing first version of Generalized Hessian. See `./generalizedHesssian/README.md` for further info
* `./matlab_maxwellian_test/`: Matlab files that implement rosenbluth Identities (see report Equations 2.19)
* `./presentations/`: All presentations (IPPL-Meetings, Langevin-Meetings, Midterm, 3weeks-, midterm- and final-presentation)
* `./report/`: Final LaTeX report files and figures
