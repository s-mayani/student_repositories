                that is, the convolution of a translation invariant, free-space
                Green's function with a compactly supported source distribution
                defined on a uniform grid. The algorithm relies on regularizing
                the Fourier transform of the Green's function by cutting off the
                interaction in physical space beyond the domain of interest. This
                permits the straightforward application of trapezoidal quadrature
                and the standard FFT, with superalgebraic convergence for smooth
                data. Moreover, the method can be interpreted as employing a
                Nystrom discretization of the corresponding integral operator,
                with matrix entries which can be obtained explicitly and rapidly.
                This is of use in the design of preconditioners or fast direct
                solvers for a variety of volume integral equations. The method
                proposed permits the computation of any derivative of the
                potential, at the cost of an additional FFT.},

                electron temperature, and therefore the maximum achievable
                electron brightness, from unstructured photoemitting materials
                producing dense relativistic or nonrelativistic photoelectron
                beams. The limit is given by electron heating that occurs just
                after emission into vacuum, and is due to poorly screened Coulomb
                interactions equivalent to disorder induced heating seen in
                ultracold neutral plasmas. We first show that traditional
                analytic methods of Coulomb collisions fail for the calculation
                of this strongly coupled heating. Instead, we employ an N-body
                tree algorithm to compute the universal scaling of the disorder
                induced heating in fully contained bunches, and show it to agree
                well with a simple model utilizing the tabulated correlated
                energy of one component plasmas. We also present simulations for
                beams undergoing Coulomb explosion at the photoemitter, and
                demonstrate that both the temperature growth and subsequent
                cooling must be characterized by correlated effects, as well as
                correlation-frozen dynamics. In either case, the induced
                temperature is found to be of several meV for typical
                photoinjector beam densities, a significant fraction of the
                intrinsic beam temperature of the coldest semiconductor
                photocathodes. Thus, we expect disorder induced heating to become
                a major limiting factor in the next generation of photoemission
                sources delivering dense bunches and employing ultra-cold
                photoemitters.},

                simulation of plasmas is described. The saving is obtained by
                integrating only the electrons through a number of time steps
                (sub-cycles) in order to resolve their evolution, while
                integrating the much slower ions only once per cycle, i.e., to
                match the time step of each species to their characteristic
                frequencies. A dispersion relation is derived which describes the
                numerical instabilities expected by sampling frequency arguments.
                Simulations support the broad features of the analytical results,
                viz., the maximum growth rate and domain of the instability, and
                its stabilization by the addition of weak damping. An implicit
                sub-cycling algorithm is suggested which may provide further
                saving while avoiding a limitation of implicit algorithms
                described elsewhere.},

                between collisionless and Coulomb collision dominated plasmas in
                particle-in-cell codes. Collisional processes between particles
                of different species are treated through the concept of a
                grid-based “collision field,” which can be particularly efficient
                for multi-dimensional applications. In this method, particles are
                scattered using a force which is determined from the moments of
                the distribution functions accumulated on the grid. The form of
                the force is such to reproduce the multi-fluid transport
                equations through the second (energy) moment. Collisions between
                particles of the same species require a separate treatment. For
                this, a Monte Carlo-like scattering method based on the Langevin
                equation is used. The details of both methods are presented, and
                their implementation in a new hybrid (particle ion, massless
                fluid electron) algorithm is described. Aspects of the collision
                model are illustrated through several one- and two-dimensional
                test problems as well as examples involving laser produced
                colliding plasmas.},
