# Semester Project

## Description
This git repository contains the main scripts and results that were generated for the completion of a semester project under the supervision of Professor Andreas Adelmann. The project includes implementing Zelâ€™dovich Linear approximation for the generation of initial conditions in the performance portable IPPL cosmology framework.

## Usage
The appendices of the report specify how to install, compile and run cosmological simulations in IPPL. The scripts in the present repository are batch scripts for running on the psi merlin cluster, as well as plotting scripts in the form of jupyter notebooks.

## Job Scripts
This folder contains all the scripts for the all the jobs that were submitted to
1) run the cosmology simulation
2) run the cosmology-new simulation with the initial condition generator
3) run the test for the initial condition isHermitian() function
4) run the scaling studies for the isHermitian() function

## Results
The results folder contains all of the results that were included in the report. Results consist of log files generated by slurm in the form of .out and .err files, as well as the timing files outputted by the simulation. The following results are included in this repository:
1) results of running the new cosmology framework including on the fly IC generation
2) results of the scaling studies
